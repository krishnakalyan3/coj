      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What languages are spoken in the camp?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">The main language in all our camps is English. As the camp is taking place in Germany, all announcements and explanations are here therefore always in German and English. Of course, all our trainers with their different nationalities are also available for individual translations.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Drugs, alcohol & Camp?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">We follow a No Drug, No Alcohol policy. We strongly believe that drugs of any kind do not belong in the hands of children & teenagers, any possession or consumption of drugs is forbidden for teenagers and children in the camp and also outside the camp. The same rule applies for accompanying adults, if any.<br><br>Violations can lead to exclusion or even to criminal charges. The term "drugs" also includes cigarettes and alcohol! Through our varied activities, we offer a much better alternative! We would like to make it clear from the outset that we are also against any form of discrimination or "putting down". This is - just like violence - immediately prevented by us, in order to offer each young person a relaxed and joyful time in the camp.</p>

        <h3 class="faq-question">Electronic equipment and valuables?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">We recommend that you do not take electronic equipment and valuables with you. We do not assume any liability. We are of the opinion that the camp time is a special experience for the participants if they do not have the headphones in their ears all the time or are busy with their mobile phones. Instead they have the chance to deal with other topics and they find time to dedicate themselves to the new people in the camp.</p>
